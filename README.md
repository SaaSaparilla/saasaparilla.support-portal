## LLM Use Disclaimer
This project is developed using llms as an autocomplete.  We see no reason to deprive ourselves of the joy of solving
problems in favor of a glorified gacha box.  PRs that are obviously generated wholesale will be rejected.  If a 
contributor answers a question on a PR with an llm or with a response that boils down to "I don't know, Claude did 
it.", the PR will be closed, and any future PRs by that user will be automatically rejected.

## License

This project is offered under a choice of licenses:

- Option C: purchase of a commercial license

SPDX expression: `(SSPL-1.0 AND PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0) OR PolyForm-Internal-Use-1.0.0`.

## Contributor License Agreement

By submitting a pull request, you agree to grant the SaaSaparilla organization the rights needed to use your 
contribution, including for commercial licensing and relicensing purposes.

The objective of this license combination is to allow organizations to use the software as an internal support portal
without granting them the right to use the software for any other commercial purposes while ensuring that the source
code remains available.  This objective is not perfectly satisfied by this license combination, but using standard
licensing terms is preferable to writing a custom license.  Should a standard license be created that better matches
the goals of this project, it will be relicensed.  We will never change the license terms in a way that prevents teams
from hosting this software internally.
